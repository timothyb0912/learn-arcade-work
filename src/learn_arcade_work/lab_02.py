This is my drawing for Lab 02.

For this lab, I will focus on the drawing that is most practically useful to me
at the moment:
a computational graph of a multinomial, neural network classifier.

This image needs to be complete by February 19th, giving me 3 Sundays
(counting Valentine's day).


What's the minimum-valuable-product?
  * A neural network with two hidden layers
  * Final Layer = Y1, Y2, Y3, ...
  * Orientation is landscape such that covariates are on the left,
  and computation flows to the right towards the outputs


What prototypes are useful and why?
  * type: paper / powerpoint-pdf
    rationale: documents the image of what I actually want.
  * type: arcade, 4-neurons_2-neurons_1-output
    rationale: |
    teaches me the basics of how to make the image in arcade,
    gives me a base to experiment with to design a easy to use code to make the
    MVP drawing.
